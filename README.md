# Emojify_v2a


mojify!
Welcome to the second assignment of Week 2. You are going to use word vector representations to build an Emojifier.

Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Your emojifier app will help you do that. So rather than writing:

"Congratulations on the promotion! Let's get coffee and talk. Love you!"

The emojifier can automatically turn this into:

"Congratulations on the promotion! üëç Let's get coffee and talk. ‚òïÔ∏è Love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

You will implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as "Let's go see the baseball game tonight!") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (‚öæÔ∏è).
